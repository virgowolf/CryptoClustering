## CryptoClustering ##
#### For this project, I applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. To run the Pythonic code, import pandas, hvplot, sklearn, numpy, and holoviews models in Jupyter Lab or Visual Studio Code. 

#### I received assistance with creating my composite plots from Xpert Learning Assistant, an AI tool provided by UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp/ bootcampspot.instructure.com. 

#### My analysis revealed that cryptocurrencies are indeed very volatile and difficult to cluster in categories.
